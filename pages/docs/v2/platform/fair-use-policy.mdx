## Usage Guidelines

We do not enforce caps on usage (bandwidth, serverless invocations, or build hours) on any of our account plans. As a guideline for our community, we expect most users to fall within the below ranges for each plan. We will notify you if your usage is an outlier. Our goal is to be as permissive as possible while not putting our business at risk economically. We'll never take a site down without notice, we'll reach out well ahead of any action and work with you to correct out of control usage.
